# Data Analysis Projects
This repository contains four projects done as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nano Degree Program:

1. [Investigate a Dataset](#project1)
2. [Analyse A/B Test Results](#project2)
3. [Data Wrangling and Analysing](#project3)
4. [Data Visualization](#project4)

## 1. Investigate a Dataset <a name="project1"></a>

The objective of this project was to familiarize with the data analysis process i.e. questioning, data wrangling, exploring, analyzing, and communicating data. The TMDB Movie Database was used for the project.

## 2. Analyse A/B Test Results <a name="project2"></a>

Through this project the application of inferential statistics and probability to A/B testing and supervised learning models has been learnt.


## 3. Data Wrangling and Analysing <a name="project3"></a>

The main goal of this project was to systematically wrangle the data through gathering, assessing and cleaning steps. The tweets data of WeRateDogs twitter account was wrangled and analysed.

## 4. Data Visualization <a name="project4"></a>
